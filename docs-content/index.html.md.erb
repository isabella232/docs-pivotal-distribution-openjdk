Pivotal Distribution of OpenJDK is a distribution of [OpenJDK&reg;](https://openjdk.java.net). It comes in two flavors:

* Binaries Pivotal builds directly from the upstream [OpenJDK Mercurial source code repository](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk). This distribution is the same OpenJDK distribution that has been distributed as part of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Java buildpack since its inception, but it is now also available for use in Pivotal Container Service, in VMs, or on bare metal via Pivotal Spring Runtime. Platform support for these binaries is limited to Ubuntu Linux.
* OpenJDK builds from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net), which offer wider platform support including macOS and Microsoft Windows.
